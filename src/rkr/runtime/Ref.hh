/***
 * A Ref instance is a bit like a register; it is serialized as the destination where a
 * resolved reference will be saved. An IR Step that resolves a reference will also have a Ref
 * pointer where it will store the resolution result. When serialized, Refs hold no data; the
 * only important aspect of a Ref in the serialized trace is its identity. One step will
 * resolve a reference and save the outcome in a Ref, and later steps may reference that
 * Ref to modify or compare contents of the resolved artifact.
