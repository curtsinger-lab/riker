/********** Channel States **********/

/**
 * Channels always have a single state. The options are:
 * - available: the channel is not in use and can be acquired by any tracee
 * - acquired: a tracee owns the channel but it is not waiting on the tracer yet
 * - pre-syscall wait: a tracee is waiting before issuing a system call
 * - post-syscall notify: a tracee has finished a system call but is not blocking
 * - post-syscall wait: a tracee has finished a system call and is waiting to be resumed
 * - proceed: the tracee can unblock
 * - observed: the tracer has observed the state of the channel and is currently handling it

/********** Channel Actions **********/

/**
 * When the tracer resumes a tracee it can request that the trace perform one of the following
 * actions:
 * - continue: the tracee can run the syscall and does not have to block
 * - notify: the tracee can run the syscall and should report the result without blocking
 * - finish: the tracee should run the syscall and block again
 * - exit: the tracee should exit instead of running the system call
 * - skip: the tracee should skip the system call and use the return value from the channel
